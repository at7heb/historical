assets of historical interest

The purpose of this repository is to hold assets and educational commentary on some historical aspects of computing. Historical means the '60s and '70s.
As my goal in creating this repository is educational, I claim this is fair use of these assets which have copyrights held by the assets' respective copyright holders.

In the '50s my involvement with computers was reading "Danny Dunn and the Homework Machine".
